## How to include HBase configuration

HBase configuration is automatically taken from the Java classpath: just add /etc/hbase/conf as driver-class-path on Spark

```
spark-submit --master yarn-client --class SimpleApp --driver-class-path "/etc/hbase/conf:/etc/hadoop/conf" --verbose --conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=false target/scala-2.10/simple-project-shaded.jar
```
